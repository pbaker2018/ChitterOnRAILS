## Chitter Challenge

This is a weekend challenge given at the end of Week 5 at Makers.

The task is to complete a very basic clone of Twitter, called 'Chitter' where users can post messages 'peeps.'

This is to be built using Ruby, Rails and the ActiveRecord ORM.

It is my first time using Rails.

## What does it do:

A user should be able to go to the homepage, where they will be able to view a preview of all previously submitted 'peeps' and then post a new 'peep'.

If they click on a previously submitted 'peep' they will be able to view the whole 'peep' and will have the option of editing it, or deleting it.

There will also be 'sign-up', 'sign-in' and 'log-out' functionality, so that only the logged-in user can post messages as themselves.


## Below are the user stories:
```
As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

As a Maker
So that only I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter
```
